### Problem Statement

India‚Äôs lakes and traditional water bodies are rapidly deteriorating due to unchecked urbanization, sewage discharge, solid-waste dumping, loss of green buffers, and fading community stewardship. Once vital for biodiversity, groundwater recharge, and local livelihoods, these ecosystems now suffer from neglect, pollution, and shrinking water capacity. Scientific lake monitoring remains limited, expensive, and inaccessible to most citizens. There is no simple way for people to assess the health of their neighborhood lake or understand how to help, leaving communities disempowered and restoration efforts under-supported.

Personal experiences with local water bodies such as Girital, Dronasagar, and numerous seasonal streams mirror a nationwide reality: the absence of a scalable, community‚Äëdriven system for monitoring, learning, and participating in lake conservation. This gap slows collective action and environmental learning, especially among students and youth who are eager to contribute but lack practical tools and guidance.

### Solution

Jheel Saathi is a web‚Äëbased, community‚Äëcentered platform that empowers citizens‚Äîespecially students, youth, and local communities‚Äîto understand and evaluate the ecological health of their neighborhood lakes and water bodies. Through an intuitive interface, users answer simple visual and text‚Äëbased questions on water clarity, biodiversity presence, vegetation, human activity, and seasonal changes. The platform generates a dynamic, easy‚Äëto‚Äëread Lake Health Report and an AI‚Äëassisted summary with actionable conservation recommendations.

Beyond data collection, Jheel Saathi is a learning experience designed to build ecological literacy and inspire behavioral change. By observing real‚Äëworld indicators, users learn concepts such as eutrophication, habitat loss, and pollution through guided, experiential interactions. The platform bridges scientific assessment with citizen participation, making lake monitoring accessible, meaningful, and classroom‚Äëfriendly.
